# Counterfactual-Monetary-Policy-Analysis
This study examines the causal impact of the COVID-19 shock and the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy interventions on India’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using advanced econometric time series models. A quarterly macroeconomic dataset spanning from 2005 to 2025 is constructed using GDP, repo rate, industrial production, mobility indicators, liquidity tools, and policy stringency measures.
The analysis begins with a SARIMAX counterfactual model to estimate what GDP would have been in the absence of the COVID-19 shock. Model diagnostics including residual independence, normality checks, and out-of-sample validation confirm a statistically coherent fit. To formally identify causal effects, a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) CausalImpact model is implemented. The posterior distributions reveal a significant negative impact on GDP during the COVID period, with a 99.9% posterior probability of a causal effect. A placebo intervention assigned to 2018 yields no detectable effect, validating the robustness of the causal inference. Given strong evidence of co integration from the Johansen test, a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is employed to capture long-run equilibrium dynamics among GDP growth, monetary policy variables, and industrial activity. Impulse response functions exhibit theoretically consistent behaviour monetary tightening reduces output, and positive industrial activity shocks stimulate growth providing structural interpretability. Across SARIMAX, BSTS, and VECM, results consistently indicate that COVID-19 led to a sharp contraction in GDP, while RBI’s accommodative monetary policy helped moderate the decline. The convergence of findings across multiple complementary models demonstrates a rigorous, multimethod approach for quantifying macroeconomic shocks and policy transmission in India.
